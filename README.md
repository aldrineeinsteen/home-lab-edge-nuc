# Homelab Edge Nuc (Windows)

Automated provisioning and hardening of a Windows-based Intel/GMKTec NUC for home labs, edge clients, or kid-friendly PCs using Ansible.

This project provides an opinionated baseline for setting up and managing a Windows NUC as a secure, always-updated, and remotely monitored edge device.
It’s designed to be reusable for:
 - 🏠 Home labs – edge nodes, dev/test boxes, monitoring clients
 - 👨‍👩‍👧 Family PCs – safe & locked-down setup for tweens/teens
 - 🌐 Edge workloads – monitored endpoints exposing metrics for Prometheus/Grafana

## 🚀 Features
 - Automatic Software Install (via Winget/Chocolatey):
 - Firefox, Thunderbird, VSCode, Python 3, Java JDK, 7-Zip, Blender, LibreOffice (Word/Excel replacement)
 - User Management
 - Creates a standard non-admin user for daily use
 - Prevents local software installs & disables Microsoft Store
 - Blocks running installers from Downloads/Temp (SRP rules)
 - Security Hardening
 - SmartScreen enabled (Explorer + Edge + apps)
 - Windows Defender real-time protection enforced
 - Hides Windows Security settings from standard users
 - System Management
 - Always-on Windows Update (auto download + scheduled install)
 - Safe reboot every Sunday at 03:00
 - Remote Monitoring
 - Installs Prometheus windows_exporter → exposes CPU, disk, and memory metrics
 - Opens firewall for metrics scraping (default http://<NUC_IP>:9182/metrics)
 - Parental Controls Ready
 - Compatible with Microsoft Family Safety (requires linking child’s Microsoft account post-setup)

## 🛠 Requirements
 - Control machine with Ansible 2.12+ and Python 3
 - Target NUC running Windows 10/11
 - Network connectivity to the NUC (WinRM enabled on 5985/5986)
